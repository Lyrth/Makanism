**This is the custom plugin directory**, nothing interesting to see here.

The plugin defined here is `extra-java-module-info`, where it automatically transforms non-modular jars into real or automatic modules. Taken from the sample found [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/samples/sample_java_modules_with_transform.html).
